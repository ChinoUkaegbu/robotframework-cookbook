# robotframework-cookbook
A curated list of delicious Robot Framework recipes that will help you develop new test automation scripts faster, especially for beginner or intermediate level engineers.

If you need help writing Robot Framework scripts or wish to update older scripts to use newer syntax then you have come to the right place.  Here we will compile and maintain recipes of working Robot Framework scripts that can be used in your domain.

# Notes for Contributors
Initially, there is no CI so please confirm any submissions are working and use `robot.tidy` to standardise the format of the scripts.

We also welcome Issues where you may post ideas for new recipes or report bugs for exisiting recipes.
