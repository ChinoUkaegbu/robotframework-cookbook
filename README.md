# robotframework-cookbook
A curated list of delicious Robot Framework recipes!

If you need help writing Robot Framework scripts or wish to update older scripts to use newer syntax then you are in the right place.  Here we will compile and maintain recipes of working Robot Framework scripts that can be used in your domain.

# Notes for contributors:
Initially, there is no CI so please confirm any submissions are working and use `robot.tidy` to standardise the format of the scripts.
